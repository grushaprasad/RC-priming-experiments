	This experiment was a part of a group of experiments using <i> syntactic priming </i> to understand how people represent sentences. Linguistic theory predicts that certain sentences are more structurally similar than other sentences. We are interested in measuring whether people's representation of sentences reflect this similarity. To investigate this question, we measured the reading time for <i>target</i> sentences with a specific structure when they were preceded by different types of <i>prime</i> sentences with varying degrees of structrual similarity to target sentences. If people's representations align with the predictions of linguistic theory, we expect 
    target sentences to be read faster when they are preceded by structurally similar primes than structurally dissimilar primes.
